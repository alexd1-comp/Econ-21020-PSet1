\section{}
Table 1 gives the joint probability mass function between employment status and college degree in the US working-age population.
\begin{center}
Table 1: Joint Probability Mass Function
\end{center}

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
 \begin{tabular}{||c c c||} 
 \hline
 & Unemployed (Y = 0) & Employed (Y = 1)  \\ [0.5ex] 
 \hline\hline
 Non-college grads (X = 0) & 0.026 & 0.576 \\ 
 College grads (X = 1) & 0.009 & 0.389 \\ [1ex] 
 \hline
 \end{tabular}
\end{table}
 a) An economic interpretation of the statement P(Y = 1, X = 1) = 0.389 is that 0.389 of the working-age population in the U.S is both a college grad and employed.
 
 b) The unconditional probability of being employed P(Y = 1) is 0.576 + 0.389 = 0.965.
 
 c) The unconditional probability of having a college degree P(X = 1) is 0.009 + 0.389 = 0.398.
 
 d) The unemployment share for college graduates is P(Y = 0 $\mid$ X = 1). 
 This is equivalent to P(X = 1 $\cap$ Y = 0) / P(X). Using the table, this is (0.009)/(0.398).
 
 The final answer is 0.009/0.398 = 0.0226.
 
 The unemployment share for non-college graduates is P(Y = 0 $\mid$ X = 0). This is equivalent to P(Y = 0 $\cap$ X = 0) / P(X). 
 Using the table this is (0.026)/(0.602).

 The final answer is 0.026/0.602 = 0.0432.
 
 e) Employment status and college degree are not independent, as P(X = 0) $\neq$ P(X = 0 $\cap$ Y = 0).
 Similarly, P(X = 1) $\neq$ P(X = 1 $\cap$ Y = 0).
 
 We got P(X = 0) = 0.602 while P (X = 0$\cap$ Y = 0) is equal to 0.026/0.035 = 0.7428. 
 
 0.602 $\neq$ 0.7428.

\section{}

Let X $\sim$N(0,1) and define Y $\equiv$ a + bX for a,b $\in$ R.

2a) E[Y] = $E_X$[h(X)], by the Law of the Unconscious Statistician.

Thus, E[Y] = $E_X$[h(X)] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty h(x)f$_X$(x)dx,
as X is continuous.

It is known that  Y $\equiv$ a + bX, so E[a + bX] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty a + bX f$_X$(x)dx

Since X is the standard normal distribution, we know that f(x)= e^{-x^2/2}/\sqrt{2\pi}

Plugging that into the prior integral, we get that E[Y] = E[a+bX] = \int_{0}^1 a + bx * e^{-x^2/2}/\sqrt{2\pi}dx

2b)

We know that Var(a+bX) = b^2Var(X), so:

Var(Y) = Var(a+bX) = $b^2Var(X)$ = $b^2$, since X is the standard normal distribution, Var(X) = 1.

% Problem 3 %%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{}

Take n $\in$ N and let {\{$X_i}\}_{i=1}}^n$ be a collection of independent random variables with supp X_i = $$\{0,1\}$ and p = P(X_i = 1),  $\forall$i = 1,....,n.
Define X_n = {\{$X_i}\}_{i=1}}^n$ $X_i$.

3a) E[X_n] = E($\sum_{i=1}^n{X_i}$)

=  $\sum_{i=1}^nE({X_i})$ by Sum of expectations of independent trials, meaning the expectation of a product of independent random variable is the product of their expectations.

We know that p = $P(X_i = 1)$ = $E(X_i)$ due  to $X_i$ being a random variable in the Bernoulli(p) distribution.

Thus, the sum of n identical $X_i$ terms is equivalent to the product of n * the expectation of $X_i$. Therefore, $E[X_n]$ = n*p = np.

3b)

We know that the expectation of a binomial distribution $E(X_n)$ = np from 3a.

Var(X) = E(X^2) = (E(X))^2

E(X^2) = np- np^2 = np(1-p)

(E(X))^2 = n^2p^2 - (np)^2 = 0

Thus Var(X) = np(1-p)
